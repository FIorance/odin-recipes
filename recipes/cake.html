            <li>Take the cake out and let it cool</li>
            <li>Cut the cake in half horizontally</li>
            <li>Heap frosting onto the bottom half and put the top back</li>

        <p>*Toothpick test is where you stick in a toothpick. If batter is on the toothpick when it's pulled out, the batter needs to stay in the oven more. If there is no batter on the toothpick, it's ready.</p>
